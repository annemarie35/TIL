# ARCHITECTURE OR DESIGN


> « A good architecture allows majoral architectural decisions to be deferred ; it maximizes the number of decisions NOT made »

> When people talk about architecture, they often think that architecture is about making decisions early. It's about making decisions late. A good architecture is a software structure that allows you to defer critical decisions for as long as possible. Defer them to the point where you've got enough information to actually make them or not make them, as the case may be. 
> Architecture, allows decisions to be deferred delayed until the last responsible moment this may fly in the face of what you think you may think: no, no, you've got to make some of these decisions early. 
> 
> Well there are some decisions that need to be made early. For example, if you're going to write an application you probably need to decide what language you're going to write it in pretty early.

> We made the decision to use Java for FitNess. That was a really early decision. 
> 
> But the database decision, which we thought we needed to make early, we were just able to push right off the end of the project. The flat files actually worked better than a database would. 
> It was fascinating to us. There were advantages to using flat files that none of us had ever conceived of before. For example, you can check the whole testing engine into source code control. 
> That one we hadn't even thought of. So there's a lot of very powerful benefits to deferring decisions as late as you possibly can.

> Good architecture maximizes the number of decisions not made.
