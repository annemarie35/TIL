> ‘An Airplane has been defined as a collection of parts having an inherent tendency to fall to earth, and requiring constant effort and supervision to stave off that outcome. The System called "airplane" may have been designed to fly, but the parts don't share that tendency. In fact, they share the opposite tendency. And the System will fly—if at all—only as a System.’— John Gall, Systemantics: The Systems Bible (the 3rd edition of Systemantics, 2002)
