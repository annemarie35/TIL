## B
- **BDD(Behavior Driven Development)**  : software development approach that focuses on defining and testing software behavior in terms of how users expect the system to behave. It encourages collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders by using plain, human-readable language (often in Given–When–Then format) to describe features and scenarios. These descriptions can then be turned into automated tests.
